# FYP-cricket-match-simulator

In this project we have used three different datasets in this project. First dataset contains all the match details that have previously been played in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The second
dataset contains the ball-by-ball data of each match that has been played in the 11 Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons. The third dataset contains all the individual batting and
bowling statistics of every player that has played in the Indian Premier League (IPL). All three datasets were cleaned. The first two datasets were merged so that we get the
ball-by-ball data and the match details in one single dataset. We created a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Machine Learning Clustering Model which was run on the batting and bowling
statistics of a player separately, so we get the batting clusters and bowling clusters of every player. This cluster data was merged with the previous ball-by-ball data. This
ball-by-ball data was run through a Random Forest Classification Model to predict the runs scored on every ball of the match.
